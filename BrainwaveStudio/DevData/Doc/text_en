You can create the desired brain state with "Brainwave Studio"
Try Brainwave Studio for deep stable, immersive learning , self-hypnosis.
============
3 . Explanation
============
Through years of research studio EEG brain wave frequencies , known by the user and so you can have a state of the EEG .
The sound output from your smartphone using the earphone user's brainwaves to a desired state EEG synchronization Binaural beats studio use .
Binaural beats and brain waves through the brain, affecting significant number of them will be created .
" Brain Wave Studio" has a positive effect on a person's brain waves delta brainwaves (Delta wave), Cee break (Theta wave), alfalfa (Alpha wave), beta waves (Beta wave), gamma waves (Gamma wave) and positive noise known as white noise (White noise), pink noise (Pink noise), Brown noise (Brown noise) is included.
* Delta (Delta wave)
   - Delta (Delta wave) is when a person is in deep sleep EEG is generated . Rigeona suffering from insomnia sleep quality in a short time using the effective when you want to take .
   - The body is experiencing tension headache , or if you close your eyes for about 10 minutes delta is a big help to run your .
* Cee break (Theta wave)
   - Cee break (Theta wave) when a shallow sleep state or meditation brain waves are generated . When the show is also called EEG powers .
   - A complete contrast to the delta wave sleep to fall into meditation because it helps when you want to relax , and even the brain very helpful.
   - Even when his character falls into a hypnotic state of hypnosis is induced brain waves to help you .
* Alpha waves (Alpha wave):
   - Alpha waves (Alpha wave) is very positive EEG When you feel mentally and physically relaxed comfort is the most likely to get brain waves .
   - An excellent stress relaxation effect is effective .
   - A lot of alfalfa come up to the state memory and concentration also useful when learning .
* Beta Wave (Beta wave):
   - 12 ~ 30Hz beta brainwaves between SMR wave parameters , which follows , M wave , H wave can be separated .
   * Beta SMR: Awakening of undonggye standby or ready state is related to attention . Useful when you want commitment .
   * Beta M: conscious activity , mental activity , a lot of learning occurs when immersed in the state . When you need to learn through immersion helpful. ( General learning is more suitable when the alfalfa )
   * Beta H: occurs when the state of tension or excitement . Exercise helps to listen to before the game . ( * Note: I usually listen to the brain can lead to tensions . )
* Gamma waves (Gamma wave)
   - Occurs when the excited state . Cognitive functioning , even when a highly active.
* White noise (White noise)
   - White noise is the frequency of the audio frequency spectrum having a wavelength range of all signals.
   - White noise to cover the effect of ambient noise to help improve attention to it .
   - In the case of white noise to hear the baby , given the stability may be taking .
   - Effective and stress -induced decrease in alpha wave effect known to be effective in improving learning skills .
* Pink Noise (Pink noise)
   - White noise and pink noise has the same effect .
   - According to the people than white noise or brown noise, pink noise can be more effective .
* Brown Noise (Brown noise):
   - White noise and pink noise has the same effect .
   - According to the people than white noise or brown noise, pink noise can be more effective .
   
" Brain Wave Studio" is the leading tone and color of each EEG noise can be played individually , as well as by the choice of each noise multiple users can play at the same time too.

* Mix the playback effect
   - Each brain wave Binaural beat is a Sine wave to be formed . Pure Sine wave , but when I heard sometimes reluctant to represent people. In this case, you play as EEG and noise can be a much more comfortable feel .
   - Each have mixed brain waves that occur when the brain waves are seokyimyeonseo any rule that can not be formed on the brain wave effect can be obtained. This effect is directly mixed with EEG Please see watching experience .
