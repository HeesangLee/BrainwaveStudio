You can create the desired brain state with "Brainwave Studio"

Try Brainwave Studio for deep stable, immersive learning , self-hypnosis.

3 . Explanation

============

You can synchronize your brainwave frequecy to well-known special frequency with application "Brainwave Studio".

"Brainwave Studio" uses Binaural Beats to generate these kinds of brainwave frequency. 

You can hear this Generated binaural beats sound with earphone output of smart-phone.

Binaural beats can create the significant brainwaves such as delta wave, theta wave, alpha wave, beta wave and gamma wave.

"Brainwave Studio" includes these significant brainwaves which have positive effect on a person and color noises-white noise, pink noise and brown noise.



* Delta wave

   - Delta wave EEG is generated when a person is in deep sleep condition.

   - If you want to effective high-quality sleep it is suitable for this purpose.

   - If your body is experiencing tension or headache, try delta wave about 10 minutes.

   - Delta wave of growing children help to generate more growth hormone(GH).



* Theta wave

   - Theta wave EEG is generated when a person is in a shallow sleep or in meditation state. 

   - Theta wave is known as generated when using psychic powers.

   - Theta wave EEG is helpful if you want to relax you brain and body.

   - Theta wave EEG is useful to induce self-hypnosis and deep meditation.



* Alpha wave

   - Alpha wave is very positive EEG. This wave is generated when a person is in relaxed and comfortable state.

   - If you want to release stress, it would be a good solution.

   - Alpha wave boosts up memory and concentration for learning



* Beta wave

   - Brainwave between 12Hz and 30Hz are Beta wave and this wave is comprised to SMR beta, M beta and H beta.

      * Beta SMR : This wave is related on preparing awakening and ready state of exercise. Useful when you want to be in immersed state.

      * Beta M : This wave is much generated when a person is on conscious activity, mental activity. It is helpful to be immersed in learning.

      * Beta H : This wave is generated when a person is in a state of tension. It is helpful to sports game.



* Gamma wave

   - Gamma wave is generated when the excited state.

   

* White noise

   - White noise has the all range of the audio frequency spectrum.

   - White noise covers the surrounded noise so it is really helpful to increase the concentration.

   - Young baby often keep their balance during hearing white noise.

   - White noise is effective to induce the alpha-wave and also helpful to increase the learning.



* Pink noise

   - Pink noise has a same effect as white-noise.

   - Pink noise can be more effective for some people than other color-noise.



* Brown noise

   - Brown noise has a same effect as white-noise.

   - Brown noise can be more effective for some people than other color-noise.



“Brainwave Studio” can play a brainwave sound individually, as well as can play multiple sounds simultaneously.



[ Mixed bainwave sounds effect ]

* Brainwave sound on this application is composed to binaural beat-aid pure sine wave. But some people feel uncomfortable to pure sine wave. In this case, it is helpful to mix the color-noise to brainwave.

* If you mix some brainwaves together, resulting arbitrary brainwave frequency would be generated and then you can experience some amazing mental status.



[ Application note ]

* Learning Improvement 

   - Learning abilities such as memory and concentration would be improved if you hear alpha-wave daily regularly.

   - Try to hear alpha-wave before learning about 30 minutes.

   - Color-noises help to concentrate on something.

   - It would be a good choice to mix the white noise to the alpha-wave.



* Deep and good Sleep

   - Modern people endless exposed to external stimulation. In addition, even at night, indoor light, TV, smart-phone, etc. disturb your brain. It is needed to turn your brain off before go to bed.

   - Theta-wave or Delta-wave can help you got deep sleep.



* Drowsiness prevention

   - Beta-wave can awake you brain.

* Meditation

- Theta-wave help to sink in meditation.(30~60 minutes sound play is recommended)



* Alleviate headache

   - In the case of stress-induced headache, close your eyes and listen delta-wave.
